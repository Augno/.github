##### _Intuitive and scalable manufacturing systems_

Augno provides the tools that every manufacturer needs to grow their business.

We began developing these tools while working in a factory and experiencing deep frustration with the available tools on the market. Here are the things we value:

#### Craftsmanship

Every small detail matters, from the errors the API returns to the small aesthetic details of the user interface. We are committed to providing backwards compatibility, and invest heavily in creating lasting designs that we can support for many years. We do not compromise on quality in order to go faster.

#### Developer Experience

Our API is designed to be world-class and delightful to use. We prioritize clear mental models, predictable patterns, and documentation that is built as a core part of the product. To that end, we provide:

- SDKs in the most popular languages
- API documentation that is always in sync with our production API
- An openapi specification to enable easier codegen
- Hand crafted tutorials and documentation

You can use these tools to customize Augno to fit your business's needs and develop your competitive edges.

#### Performance and Reliability

Our tools are used to run businesses in hyper-competitive markets and under strict regulatory oversight. We understand that our customers depend on us for their operations, and we take that responsibility seriously. Our systems are built for high availability, low latency, and consistent performance under load. We invest heavily in automated testing and observability to ensure that we can identify and resolve issues before they impact our users.
